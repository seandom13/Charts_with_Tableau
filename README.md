#Charts with Tableau

In this project, I had a dataset for Citibike Quarter 1 2019 and I wanted to gain some meaningful insights about 
the demographics of the customers that use Citibike. I made 3 charts creating a small dashboard using Tableau. Below 
are the contents of the charts:
*Trip Duration by Birth Year
*Starttimes by Hour of the Day and Grouped by Gender
*Map of all the Stations included in the Dataset
